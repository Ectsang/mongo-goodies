MongoDB Notes

V3 uses new storage engine API - can be pluggable to extend with new capabilities
MMAPv1 (default)
WiredTiger

mongod --storageEngine WiredTiger

MongoDB to process an op on an object, that object must be in memory

If working set > available mem on a single server -> shard across multiple servers

Pay attn to “read-ahead” setting, too large is not good.

Secondary indexing capabilities for query performance optimization

Issue updates as find and set operations; don’t perform document rewrites
Rather than retrieving the entire document in your application, updating fields and then saving the document back to the db, instead use find and set operators to issue the update to specific fields => less network usage, fewer round trips, fewer unnecessary index updates

Avoid negation in queries if possible - if negation is the only condition, all records need to be scanned

Run explain() on every query - https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/?_ga=1.129262028.1780282658.1457421597

Use covered queries when possible - returns results from indexes directly w/o accessing documents (all fields in the query must be present in the index) 
explain() output displays true for the indexOnly field

To increase read capacity in your system consider sharding

Use small field names

Avoid indexes on low cardinality fields

Avoid regex - leading wildcards may result in full index scans

Readahead size should be set to 32 or the size of most documents, whichever is larger
